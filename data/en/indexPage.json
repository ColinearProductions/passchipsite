    "text":"In 2012, we and the independent Romanian company CONIC DESIGN laid the foundation for a strong partnership in our safe and security activity by establishing a global agreement for installing the state of the art CONIC DESIGN’s new access control solutions for securing our entire network of agencies, in total over 200 branches. The technical solution consists of installing the very sophisticated entrance system PASSCHIP developed by CONIC DESIGN in order to secure all the entrances in the „private banking zones” by IP bank smart card chip readers. The project is now in the middle of the implementation phase, and in this stage we evaluate that our requirements are fully met, even exceeds our initial expectations requested in the tender documentation, our clients’ feedbacks are very encouraging. Our increased security level proves now that our investment and front image are protected by one of the strongest and most stable access control platform we ever tested, offering us the detailed reports and total IP control about the public access transactions in our agencies. Implementing PASSCHIP offered by CONIC DESIGN, we count remarkable savings, significantly reducing our costs with guards, transport, customer care department and other related expenses, at the same time improving our security and client’s comfort during their self-banking activity in our agencies.
